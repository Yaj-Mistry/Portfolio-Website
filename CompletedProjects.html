                This is a
                <a class="hyperlink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/Idonthaveaname/full/8WRMTWpI_"> snake prototype </a>
                that I made a couple years ago. To make this
                I first <br> divided the canvasinto a grid with each cell
                being a 20 by 20 pixel square<br>and I lower the framerate
                as well. After that I made the snake itself, At first I was <br>
                confused on how to make the snake body,but then I realized,
                it should be an array. <br>The head of the snake is an
                independant object its just the tail. The tail is an array <br>
                where everytime the head makes contact with the apple, I add
                on to the array. <br> After I've added an element to the array
                I run a for loop and add a square <br>to the back of the snake
                for every element in the array.
