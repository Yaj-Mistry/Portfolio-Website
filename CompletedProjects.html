                This is a
                <a class="hyperlink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/Idonthaveaname/full/8WRMTWpI_"> snake prototype </a>
                that I made a couple years ago. To make this
                I first <br> divided the canvasinto a grid with each cell
                being a 20 by 20 pixel square<br>and I lower the framerate
                as well. After that I made the snake itself, At first I was <br>
                confused on how to make the snake body,but then I realized,
                it should be an array. <br>The head of the snake is an
                independant object its just the tail. The tail is an array <br>
                where everytime the head makes contact with the apple, I add
                on to the array. <br> After I've added an element to the array
                I run a for loop and add a square <br>to the back of the snake
                for every element in the array.

            <p>This is a <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/Yaj-Mistry/First-Person-Controller">first person
                    controller</a> that I made for Unity 3D. <br> make this I had learn a lot more about the Unity's
                vast
                library and physics system as well as learn raycasts.<br> At the start of this project I made a simple
                scene
                with an empty player object and a couple scripts to<br> control the movement. Early on in the project I
                realized that the old system that Unity used for registering<br> input was not that useful to me so I
                decieded to switch to the newer one. After I imported the <br> assets for the new system, I made a new
                control scheme and a new script and started to map out my <br>inputs. After I did that I had a big
                choice to
                make, did I want to use the prebuilt Unity Character Controller, <br> or make my own custom one; I chose
                to
                make a custom one. To start with this I made simple movement where<br> I apply a force on top my player
                when
                the move key is touched. <br> After that I struggled with making the camera move. The way I did this is
                I first locked the cursor to the center if the screen. Then I made the mouse value a delta, which just
                makes a Vector2 and for the X value puts in the distance the mouse moved and same with the Y, this value
                refreshes every frame. I took that Vector2 and just moved the camera the amount that the mouse moved in
                each direction, for the X value I rotated the full playerbody and the Y value I just rotated the camera.
                After that I added a sort of an inventory system where the objects that the player can pick up have a
                tag and I set the collison system so it colision it triggers a script where I instansiate the objectand
                make it a child of the player. Then I delete the old one and I can cycle through the picked up objects.
